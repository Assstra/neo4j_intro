# Graph database and distributed database introduction

Welcome to **neo4j_spark**, a repository designed to introduce the concepts of **Graph Databases** and **Database Distribution** using **Neo4j** and **Apache Spark**. This repository is a hand-on and a report method for all the activities done previously.

---

## üìå Project Structure

The repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Neo4j - Graph Databases**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Spark - Distributed Databases**

Each section contains **activities** to help you practice and apply the concepts learned.
